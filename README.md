Examples were tested in Firefox 14 and sometimes make use of the advanced JavaScript features that are not
yet widely supported, for example, destructuring binding of variables. Usage of such constructs could have easily
been avoided but there was no such goal. Most of the time the code is just plain standard JavaScript.

The goal of the project is to show the power and flexibility of JavaScript. I learned something myself and wanted to share this
with people who would like to learn more about what JavaScript can do as well.

The code is a port to JavaScript of Ruby examples from the blog series 
"Higher-Order Ruby" http://blog.grayproductions.net/categories/higherorder_ruby by James Edward Gray II

which is in turn based on the Perl examples from the book "Higher-Order Perl" by Mark Jason Dominus http://hop.perl.plover.com/

If you like the algorithms, please, consider buying this excellent book and learning a bit of Perl:)
